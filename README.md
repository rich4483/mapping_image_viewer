GUI-based python app using PyQt5 for UI

I have worked mostly in embedded and backend throughout my career. But I have done some frontend work out of necessity. While working as an Engineering Team Leader developing map data for General Motors' SuperCruise, I developed this image viewer python app using PyQt5 for the UI.

Our company collected their own LiDAR and camera imagery as the data source for our maps. In some cases, we required a backup data source for camera imagery. One option we considered was using APIs from an image provider to locate camera imagery at specified LAT/LONG coordinates, and developing an application to integrate that imagery into our Data Lake.

As Engineering Team Leader, responsbile for Data Lake ingest, and owner of various software tools, I took the initiative to develop a quick proof-of-concept app to demonstrate the benefits of this option.

The app was such a success, that we added it to our tool suite, refining the proof-of-concept into a finished product.
